Hello!
This is a really simple app/website that gives you information on the weather of a city that you input. 
Specifically, the temperature, weather (sunny, cloudy, etc), humidity, and wind speed!

I used the free OpenWeatherMap API to gather city weather data.

Additionally, there is a button at the bottom that you can click that will give you information on Product Manager Accelerator that is copied from the company's LinkedIn.

To run the code you can run this in the terminal: node index.js
